While there are no dedicated tool/function calling special tokens, you can prompt it to do function calling through careful instruction. Gemma 3 27B is available via [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemma-3-27b-it) and the Gen AI API. Get an API key from [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and use it to make requests to the Gen AI API.\n",
