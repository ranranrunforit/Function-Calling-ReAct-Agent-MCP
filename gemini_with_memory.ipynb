        "\n",
        "By default, large language models (LLMs) are stateless, which means they do not remember past conversations. This can make it difficult to create truly personal and helpful AI applications. This guide shows you how to add long-term memory to your Gemini 2.5 chatbot using the Gemini API and [Mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0).\n",
        "\n",
        "By adding a memory system, your chatbot can:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Remember details about the user from past conversations.\n",
        "*   Give answers that are more relevant and personal.\n",
        "*   Stop asking the same questions over and over.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we will use `mem0`, an open-source tool for giving AI agents long-term memory and Gemini 2.5 Flash as the LLM. We will build a simple chatbot that saves what you talk about and uses that history to give you better, more personalized answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How does Mem0 work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Mem0 is designed to equip AI agents with scalable long-term memory, effectively addressing the limitations of fixed context windows in LLMs. At its core, mem0 works by reactively extracting, consolidating, and retrieving salient information from ongoing conversations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process is split into four steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Extract salient information from conversations using an LLM with dual context (a conversation summary combined with recent messages).\n",
        "2. Use LLM to process context and extract important new information and compares them against existing ones using semantic similarity.\n",
        "3. Update Memory (ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, or NOOP), for Mem0g variant (graph), extract entities and relationships.\n",
        "4. Use vector similarity search to fetch relevant memories for response generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "It uses vector embeddings to store and retrieve semantic information, maintaining user-specific context across sessions, and implementing efficient retrieval mechanisms for relevant past interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "To get started, we need to install the Mem0 library and the Gemini API client."

It's a thrilling story of a lone astronaut on a mission to save humanity, filled with clever problem-solving and scientific detail. As for tech non-fiction, given your professional background, you might find The Age of AI: And Our Human Future by Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher to be a thought-provoking read.

Reaching the Summit as Successful Deployment: The satisfaction of reaching a summit after a hard climb can be compared to the successful deployment of a model that solves a real-world problem.
