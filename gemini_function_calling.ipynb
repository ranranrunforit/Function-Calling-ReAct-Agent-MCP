        "\n",
        "Function calling is the capability to connect LLMs to external tools and to interact with your code and APIs in a structured way. Instead of generating text responses, LLMs understand when to call specific functions and provide the necessary parameters to execute real-world actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this guide, we'll look at a practical weather-based assistant access to a weather API. Yes, not very creative, but there is a free API we can use and it should be enough to demonstrate the concept understand how you can use function calling to build a more complex assistant.  \n",
        "\n",

        "## How does function calling work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Function calling may imply that the LLM is directly performing some action. This is not the case! When a user prompts an LLM with function calling, the model analyzes the input and determines if and which function would be the most appropriate for the task (can be a single function or multiple functions). Instead of providing a text response, the model generates a structured JSON object that specifies which function to call and the necessary parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Function Intro](../assets/function-intro.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice function calling not only describe the process of generating structured output, but also the process of calling a function and how to handle the output. As you don't want to return the raw output of the function to your user, you want the LLM to generate an appropriate response, based on the conversation history.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Function calling](../assets/function-calling.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Practical Function Calling follows these steps:\n",
        "1. Your application sends a prompt to the LLM along with function definitions\n",
        "2. The LLM analyzes the prompt and decides whether to respond directly or use defined functions\n",
        "3. If using functions, the LLM generates structured arguments for the function call\n",
        "4. Your application receives the function call details and executes the actual function\n",
        "5. The function results are sent back to the LLM\n",
        "6. The LLM provides a final response incorporating the function results\n",
        "\n",
        "This cycle can continue as needed, allowing for complex multi-step interactions between the application and the LLM. It is also possible that the LLM decides that it needs to call multiple functions after each other or in parallel before returning a final response to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## When to Use Function Calling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Function calling has emerged as one of the popular methods for building AI agents. It can help build human-AI interfaces that access and query real-time information from external sources like APIs, databases, and knowledge bases while providing a natural language interface (text or audio) to users.\n",
        "\n",
        "Function calling enables automation tasks like scheduling appointments, creating invoices, or sending reminders. An example usecase could be a customer service assistant might use function calling to seamlessly handle tasks like checking order status, processing returns, and updating customer information – all while maintaining a natural conversation flow with the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "You now longer need to build Applications which required complex forms or multiple steps to collect information from the user. Instead, you can build a natural language interface that allows the user to interact with the application in a conversational way. Or have no user interface at all and let the LLM interact with the world on your behalf.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Function Calling with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash\n",
        "\n",
        "Google Gemini 2.0 Flash supports function calling through multiple interfaces, [OpenAPI compatible JSON Schema](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#schema) and Python functions defintions with docstrings. If you are using JavaScript/Typescript you currently have to use the JSON Schema interface. The Python SDK `google-genai` can automatically generate the JSON Schema from the Python function definitions and docstrings. We are going to take a look at both interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "_Note: Gemini 2.0 Flash currently doesn't support `anyOf` type in the JSON Schema._\n",
        "\n",
        "Lets start with the JSON Schema interface, but before that lets install the `google-genai` library and make sure we have a Gemini API key. If you don't have one yet you can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)."
